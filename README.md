# Kitty Rolodex!

This project was just to show a basic understanding of react build and publish process, show off a little styling, and is heavily based upon the [Zero 2 Mastery Course](https://zerotomastery.io/) on react. Minor changes to content, styling (to make it more responsive), and a few changes to component layout. Not greatest project of all time but I thought it was fun and cute way to show basic knowledge.
